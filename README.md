Tracking Cursor Movement Using CSS Eyes!

In this project, the code is using CSS and JavaScript to track the movement of the user's cursor. By using a function that calculates the relative position of the mouse, we eventually update the CSS classes to mimic the cursor movement of the user.

How to Run: Download the files, and pull out "index.html" into a browser to try!

Future Improvements:
